# RAG-based QA Bot and Interactive Interface

## Overview

This repository contains two key components developed as part of a Gen AI Engineer / Machine Learning Engineer assignment:

1. **Part 1:** A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for a Question Answering (QA) bot, designed to Load data from a url and answer for user's queries using vector-based retrieval and generative modeling.
2. **Part 2:** An interactive QA bot interface allowing users to upload PDF documents, ask questions, and retrieve contextually relevant answers.

## Project Structure

- `sample_set_assesment_part1.ipynb`: This notebook contains answer for part 1.
- `sample_set_assesment_part2.ipynb`: This notebook contains answer for part 2.

## Key Features

- **RAG-based Model:** Utilizes a vector database (FAISS) to store document embeddings and retrieve relevant sections.
- **Interactive Interface:** Built using Gradio, allowing users to upload PDFs and ask questions in real time.
- **Document Segment Retrieval:** Displays the document segments used to generate responses.

## Setup and Usage

1. All the Notebooks are well documented
